This is dependent on what 'concert' is pointing to in your /etc/hosts file.

1) Use the concert_konsole to connect to the concert and ensure gateway heartbeats are ok
2) Use the concert_env to check what semantics are running (and if you have a care, change/restart the concert)
3) Use the balcony launcher to open up the web application
